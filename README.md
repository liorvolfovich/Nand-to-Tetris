This repository contains projects 1-8 and 10-11 from the Nand to Tetris course. The course takes you on a journey from constructing basic logic gates to building a fully functional computer system from scratch.

## Projects Overview

1. **Project 1: Boolean Logic**  
   Built basic logic gates such as AND, OR, NOT, and XOR using the NAND gate. These gates form the fundamental building blocks of more complex circuits.

2. **Project 2: Boolean Arithmetic**  
   Extended basic gates to arithmetic operations, focusing on creating adders and binary arithmetic units that form the basis of computer calculations.

3. **Project 3: Sequential Logic**  
   Built sequential chips like registers and counters to manage state and memory in a computing environment. This project introduced the concept of clocked circuits.

4. **Project 4: Machine Language**  
   Designed and implemented a simple assembly language to understand the low-level language that interfaces directly with the hardware built in previous projects.

5. **Project 5: Computer Architecture**  
   Complete the construction of the entire computer by integrating all the components built so far. We create the central processing unit (CPU), memory, and control logic, bringing everything together into a fully functional computer.

6. **Project 6: Assembler**  
   Developed an assembler in Python to translate symbolic assembly language programs into binary machine code, allowing programming of the custom-built CPU.

7. **Project 7: Virtual Machine I**  
   The first part of building a stack-based virtual machine (VM) in Python that acts as an intermediate layer between high-level languages and machine code. Implemented basic arithmetic, logical operations, and program flow control.

8. **Project 8: Virtual Machine II**  
   Extended the VM implementation with support for memory access, function calls, and return handling in Python, allowing the VM to support complex program structures.

10. **Project 10: Compiler I**  
   Created a syntax analyzer in Python that translates high-level language constructs into VM commands, focusing on parsing and generating code for expressions, statements, and control flow.

11. **Project 11: Compiler II**  
   Extended the compiler to handle functions, objects, and advanced programming structures, fully translating high-level programs into executable VM code.
