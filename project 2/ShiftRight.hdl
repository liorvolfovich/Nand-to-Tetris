/**
 * 16-bit right-shifter.
 *
 * The chip's output is a "right-shift" of the input:
 * - Every input bit is moved one position to the right
 * - A new bit which is equal to the sign bit is inserted as the left-most bit
 *
 * For example:
 * ShiftRight(0000000000000001)=0000000000000000 // ShiftRight(1)=0
 * ShiftRight(0100000000000000)=0010000000000000
 * ShiftRight(1100000000000000)=1110000000000000
 *
 * Note that this operation is (usually) equivalent to dividing the input by 2.
 * This definition is also called an arithmetic right-shift, and is useful for
 * the efficient implementation of various operations which we will see later on
 * in the course.
 * Another variant is the logical right-shift, which always inserts a new '0'
 * bit.
